      Depth-First Search (DFS) is a fundamental algorithm used to explore and traverse graphs and trees.
      It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, making it a powerful tool for various applications.
    </p>  
    <h2>How DFS Works</h2>
    <p>
      DFS starts at a given node (called the root) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack data structure (either explicitly or through recursion) to keep track of the nodes to be explored.
    </p>
    <h2>DFS Algorithm Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Start at the root node and mark it as visited.</li>  
      <li>Push the current node onto the stack.</li>
      <li>Explore all unvisited neighbors of the current node.</li>
      <li>Mark the neighbor as visited.</li>
      <li>Push the neighbor onto the stack.</li>
      <li>Repeat steps 2-5 for all unvisited neighbors of the current node.</li>
      <li>Backtrack by popping the current node off the stack.</li>
    </ol>
